# The Hybrid Bootstrap
This repository contains the code used to generate https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07316.  Note that it is designed to be viewed in Emacs (so that the sections and code will be folded).
However, the code used in a particular paper section should be in that section or it's location will be obvious from a no-web ("<<>>") expansion so the whole text file can be navigated with judicious use of search.

If you didn't understand any of that, the key points are that all the original code and the text of the paper are in the .org file, which is basically a text file and looks much more organized when viewed with Emacs.  If you do not like Emacs and want to view it on GitHub, use "raw" mode so that GitHub does not attempt (and fail) to render the .org file.
